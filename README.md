## About The Project

One of my very first Django projects. This is a simple landing page, the feature of which is localization into 5 different languages. 

### So,
* This project aims to provide a seamless experience for users by offering localization in 5 different languages, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity
* I plan to expand and refine this template to better cater to diverse project requirements and user preferences. The plan is to fix a lot of flaws.
* In addition, I integrated the django-user-agents==0.4.0 package to determine the type of device accessing the website, whether it's a phone or a PC. This enables the display of specific versions of the website tailored to the device, enhancing the user experience and usability

And version of Django in this project is 4.2.1.
